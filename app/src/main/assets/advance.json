    "name": "head command",
    "detail": "The head command is used to view the first lines of any text file. By default, it will show the first ten lines, but you can change this number to your liking. For example, if you only want to show the first five lines, type head -n 5 filename.ext."

    "name": "kill command",
    "detail": "If you have an unresponsive program, you can terminate it manually by using the kill command. It will send a certain signal to the misbehaving app and instructs the app to terminate itself.

    There is a total of sixty-four signals that you can use, but people usually only use two signals:
    
    SIGTERM (15) — requests a program to stop running and gives it some time to save all of its progress. If you don’t specify the signal when entering the kill command, this signal will be used.
    SIGKILL (9) — forces programs to stop immediately. Unsaved progress will be lost.
    Besides knowing the signals, you also need to know the process identification number (PID) of the program you want to kill. If you don’t know the PID, simply run the command ps ux.
    
    After knowing what signal you want to use and the PID of the program, enter the following syntax:
    
    kill [signal option] PID."
